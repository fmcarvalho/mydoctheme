HtmlFlow version 2.1 was updated to release 1.0.10 of `com.github.xmlet.HtmlApi` and
introduces a couple of new features:

* New `render()` which produces a `String` rather then writing to a `PrintStream`.
This `render()` uses internally a `StringBuilder` and shows better performance
than the `write()` approach.

* To allow `HtmlView` being a parent element of `Html` we made `HtmlView<T>` extend
`AbstractElement<HtmlView<T>, Element>` and turn it compatible with `Element`. 
Yet, it does not support `accept(ElementVisitor visitor)` nor `cloneElem()`.

* Fix `Html root` field definition in `HtmlView` to include the generic parent as `Html<HtmlView>`
and add it as child of that `HtmlView`.

* New static factory method `html()` used to start building a `HtmlView`.

* All these features together with the existing `ยบ()` make possible to build a view in a single
pass, reducing the number of auxiliary variables capturing intermediate elements.
Now all the views of the examples of this `README.md` are built in static fields assignment.
More usage examples in [HtmlTables](src/test/java/htmlflow/test/HtmlTables.java) and
[HtmlLists](src/test/java/htmlflow/test/HtmlLists.java).
