summary: "HTML header from a template resource"
---


Read HTML header from a template resource located in `templates/HtmlView-Header.txt`.
This template is bundled and loaded form the HtmlFlow JAR by default.
However, you are free to use your own header template file `templates/HtmlView-Header.txt`
and include its location in the classpath to replace the existing one.
This also solves the #16 Issue.
