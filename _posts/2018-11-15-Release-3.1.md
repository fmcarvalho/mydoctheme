summary: "Code coverage. Sonar and Issue 14."  
---

Add support for non thread-safe views. Now, in order to use the same view by multiple threads you 
should call the `threadSafe()` method. Check the unit test 
[testDivDetailsBindingWithRender](src/test/java/htmlflow/test/TestDivDetails.java#L141)
that renders 4 different context models in parallel with the same view.
